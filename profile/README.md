# Team h(ERM)es

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the GitHub profile of **Team h(ERM)es**!

We are students at the **Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) - School of Computer Science and Information Technology / Engineering & Architecture**, participating in the Product Development Project Module (PREN).

Our team name, **h(ERM)es**, stands for **Efficient Robot Movement**, which is the core principle guiding our project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission: The "Pathfinder Implementation"

We are tasked with bringing our "Pathfinder" concept (developed in PREN 1) to life. This involves designing, building, and programming a fully **autonomous, reliable, and fast vehicle** capable of navigating to a specified target position.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Aspects of Our Project:

*   **Autonomous Vehicle Development:** Engineering a robust robotic platform from concept to a functional prototype.
*   **Efficient Robot Movement (ERM):** Focusing on algorithms and designs that enable swift and precise navigation.
*   **Competition:** Demonstrating our Pathfinder's capabilities in a competitive setting against other student teams.
*   **Sustainability Focus:** Analyzing the environmental impact of our design, including material choices and life cycle considerations.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Presentation:** Clearly documenting our design process, challenges, and solutions, culminating in a final presentation and poster.
